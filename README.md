# algorithms

This repository contains some algorithms I have used, or my modifications to them, or some algorithms that I have come up with.

Dijkstra's algorithm - An algorithm to find the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph.

Telephone network - A modofocation to Dijkstra's algorithm, where I have converted it from a shortest path algo, to a longest path algo, and applied it to a telephone network.

Cows & Bulls - An application of the classic game by the same name.
